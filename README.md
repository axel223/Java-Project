# Interactive Polygon Area Calculator for Multithreaded Environment.

## Abstract
This applet allows the user to manipulate a square into any valid 3 or 4 sided polygon by
dragging &amp; dropping its vertex points to change the polygon&#39;s shape. When the vertex
is repositioned, the area of the polygon, angle measurements and side lengths
are calculated and displayed.

## That's how it looks
